# Blog Guide: How to Add New Blog Posts

This guide explains how to add new blog posts to your website. The blog system is designed to be simple and requires no HTML knowledge‚Äîjust write in Markdown and update a JSON file!

## Quick Start: Adding a New Post

### Step 1: Write Your Post in Markdown

1. Create a new file in the `blog/posts/` folder
2. Name it descriptively, for example: `my-new-post-2025.md`
3. Write your content using Markdown formatting (see guide below)

**Example:**
```markdown
# My Amazing Blog Post Title

This is the first paragraph of my blog post. I can write naturally and the system will format it nicely.

## A Subheading

Here's more content with a [link](https://example.com) and some **bold text**.

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
- Bullet point 3

That's it!
```

### Step 2: Add an Entry to posts.json

Open `blog/posts.json` and add a new entry for your post:

```json
{
  "id": "my-new-post-2025",
  "title": "My Amazing Blog Post Title",
  "date": "2025-10-15",
  "author": "Azeez Adewale Hamzat",
  "category": "Academic Reflections",
  "tags": ["Research", "PhD", "Insights"],
  "excerpt": "A brief 1-2 sentence description of what this post is about. This will appear on the blog index page.",
  "image": "images/blog/my-post-image.jpg",
  "readingTime": "5 min read",
  "content": "blog/posts/my-new-post-2025.md"
}
```

**Important:** Add a comma after the previous post's closing `}` bracket!

### Step 3: Add a Featured Image

1. Choose or create an image for your post
2. Resize it to approximately 1200x600 pixels
3. Optimize it (compress to < 200KB if possible)
4. Save it in `images/blog/`
5. Reference it in the posts.json entry

### Step 4: Test

1. Open `blog.html` in your browser
2. Your new post should appear at the top (most recent first)
3. Click it to make sure it loads correctly

## Markdown Formatting Guide

Markdown is a simple way to format text. Here's everything you need:

### Headings
```markdown
# Heading 1 (Main Title - use once per post)
## Heading 2 (Major sections)
### Heading 3 (Subsections)
```

### Text Formatting
```markdown
**Bold text**
*Italic text*
***Bold and italic***
```

### Links
```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
[Email link](mailto:your@email.com)
```

### Lists

**Bullet points:**
```markdown
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

**Numbered lists:**
```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

### Quotes
```markdown
> This is a quote or callout
> It can span multiple lines
```

### Images
```markdown
![Alt text describing the image](../images/blog/image-name.jpg)
```
*Note: Use `../` because the markdown file is in a subfolder*

### Code

**Inline code:**
```markdown
Use `code` for inline code snippets
```

**Code blocks:**
````markdown
```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
````

### Horizontal Lines
```markdown
---
```

### Line Breaks
Add two spaces at the end of a line, or leave a blank line between paragraphs.

## Tips for Great Blog Posts

### Writing
1. **Start strong**: Hook readers in the first paragraph
2. **Use headings**: Break up long posts with descriptive headings
3. **Be conversational**: Write like you're talking to a colleague
4. **Show, don't just tell**: Use examples and stories
5. **End with a call-to-action**: Invite discussion or questions

### Formatting
1. **Keep paragraphs short**: 3-4 sentences max
2. **Use lists**: They're easy to scan
3. **Add images**: Break up text visually
4. **Bold key points**: Help readers scan
5. **Link to sources**: Give credit and provide references

### SEO-Friendly
1. **Use keywords naturally**: In title, headings, and first paragraph
2. **Write descriptive excerpts**: These appear in search results
3. **Add alt text to images**: Helps with accessibility and SEO
4. **Link to related posts**: Keeps readers engaged

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Post doesn't appear
- Check `posts.json` for syntax errors (missing commas, brackets)
- Verify the markdown file path is correct
- Make sure the date format is correct (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Images don't load
- Check the image path is correct
- Verify the image file exists in the specified folder
- Make sure image filename matches exactly (case-sensitive!)
- Use forward slashes `/` not backslashes `\`

### Formatting looks wrong
- Check your Markdown syntax
- Leave blank lines between paragraphs
- Make sure code blocks use triple backticks

### JSON syntax errors
- Every opening `{` needs a closing `}`
- Every opening `[` needs a closing `]`
- Use commas between entries (but not after the last one)
- All text values need quotes `"like this"`
- Use a JSON validator: jsonlint.com

## Complete Example: Adding a New Post

Here's a complete example from start to finish:

### 1. Create the Markdown file: `blog/posts/phd-first-year-reflections.md`

```markdown
# Reflections on My First Year as a PhD Student

A year ago, I started my PhD journey at TU Dublin. Here's what I've learned so far.

## The Good

The intellectual freedom has been incredible. I can explore ideas deeply and follow interesting tangents.

## The Challenging

Time management is harder than expected. There's always more to read, write, and explore.

## Key Lessons

1. **Set boundaries**: It's easy to work all the time
2. **Build community**: Connect with other PhD students
3. **Celebrate small wins**: Progress isn't always obvious

What's your experience been like?
```

### 2. Add image to `images/blog/phd-reflections.jpg`

### 3. Update `blog/posts.json`:

```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": "phd-first-year-reflections",
      "title": "Reflections on My First Year as a PhD Student",
