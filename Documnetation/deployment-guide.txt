```

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository Settings > Pages
2. Under "Source", select "main" branch
3. Click Save
4. Your site will be live at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/`

### Step 5: Connect Custom Domain
1. In Settings > Pages, enter your custom domain: `azeezhamzat.com`

   - Add an A record pointing to:
     - 185.199.108.153
     - 185.199.109.153
     - 185.199.110.153
     - 185.199.111.153
   - Add a CNAME record: `www` pointing to `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`
4. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

## Domain Configuration

Regardless of hosting platform, you'll need to configure DNS. Here's how:

### Where to Configure DNS
Your domain registrar (where you bought azeezhamzat.com):
- Namecheap
- GoDaddy
- Google Domains
- Cloudflare
- etc.

### Typical DNS Records

**For GitHub Pages:**
```
Type: A      Name: @      Value: 185.199.108.153
Type: A      Name: @      Value: 185.199.109.153
Type: A      Name: @      Value: 185.199.110.153
Type: A      Name: @      Value: 185.199.111.153
Type: CNAME  Name: www    Value: YOUR-USERNAME.github.io
```

**For Netlify/Vercel:**
Follow the specific DNS instructions provided in their dashboards.

### DNS Propagation
- Usually takes 1-24 hours
- Sometimes up to 48 hours
- Check status: https://dnschecker.org

## Troubleshooting

### Site not loading
- Check DNS configuration
- Wait for DNS propagation (24-48 hours)
- Verify files uploaded correctly
- Check browser console for errors

### Images not displaying
- Check file paths (case-sensitive!)
- Verify images uploaded to correct folder
- Check image file sizes (compress if > 200KB)

### Form not working
- Verify Formspree endpoint is correct
- Check that email address is correct
- Test form submission
- Check spam folder for form emails

### Custom domain not working
- Double-check DNS records
- Wait for propagation
- Try in incognito mode (clears cache)
- Use DNS checker: https://dnschecker.org

## Performance Optimization

After deployment, check performance:

### Tools
- Google PageSpeed Insights: https://pagespeed.web.dev
- GTmetrix: https://gtmetrix.com
- WebPageTest: https://www.webpagetest.org

### Optimization Checklist
- [ ] Compress all images (TinyPNG.com)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Minimize redirects
- [ ] Enable caching (automatic on Netlify/Vercel)
- [ ] Use CDN (automatic on Netlify/Vercel)

## Backup Strategy

### Regular Backups
1. Keep local copy of all files
2. Push to GitHub regularly (serves as backup)
3. Download database/content periodically
4. Export blog posts (they're just markdown files!)

### Version Control
Use Git to track changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated blog post"
git push
```
