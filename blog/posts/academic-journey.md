# From Nigeria to Morocco to Ireland: My Academic Journey

My academic journey has taken me across three countries and through diverse intellectual traditions—from agricultural science in Nigeria to collective intelligence in Morocco, and now to the sociology of AI in Ireland. Each stage has shaped my thinking in unexpected ways and led me to questions I never anticipated asking.

## Nigeria: Where It All Began

I started my academic journey at Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) in Ogbomoso, Nigeria, studying Crop and Environmental Protection. On the surface, this might seem far removed from my current work in collective intelligence and AI. But those years taught me crucial lessons about systems thinking and the importance of understanding complex interactions.

My undergraduate thesis focused on using essential oils to prevent fungal rot in stored millet—a practical problem affecting smallholder farmers. Even then, I was interested in how local knowledge and scientific methods could come together to address real-world challenges. This early exposure to agricultural communities would later influence my Master's research.

## The Transition to Morocco

In 2020, I made a significant leap: moving to Morocco to pursue a Master's in Collective Intelligence at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P). This program, one of the first of its kind globally, brought together students from over 15 countries to study how groups make decisions and solve problems together.

### Discovering Collective Intelligence

The Master's program opened up an entirely new intellectual world. We studied cognitive science, participatory governance, experimental methods, and data science—all through the lens of understanding collective intelligence. How do groups become smarter than the sum of their parts? What conditions enable or hinder collective thinking? These questions became central to my intellectual development.

For my Master's thesis, I returned to Nigerian agricultural communities, but with a new framework. I investigated how collective intelligence principles could improve decision-making among smallholder farmers, specifically examining their perceptions of cluster farming. The research combined participatory methods with systems thinking, bridging my agricultural background with my new training in collective intelligence.

### Cross-Cultural Learning

Living in Morocco was transformative beyond academics. Navigating a new language (Arabic and French), understanding different cultural norms, and building friendships across diverse backgrounds taught me invaluable lessons about communication, adaptation, and the importance of cultural context in understanding social phenomena.

The international student cohort meant engaging daily with perspectives from Latin America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. These interactions deepened my appreciation for how cultural context shapes the way groups think, decide, and collaborate—insights that continue to inform my research.

## Working at UM6P's Africa Initiative

After completing my Master's, I joined UM6P's Africa Initiative as an Outreach Officer. This role involved facilitating partnerships for sustainable development across the African continent, coordinating with government officials, academic institutions, and NGOs from multiple countries.

The work taught me practical lessons about stakeholder engagement, cross-cultural collaboration, and the complexities of translating research into action. Organizing over 25 high-level events and managing 50+ international partnerships required understanding diverse perspectives, navigating different communication styles, and building trust across institutional and cultural boundaries.

These experiences reinforced a key insight: effective collaboration requires more than good intentions—it requires understanding group dynamics, building inclusive processes, and creating conditions where diverse perspectives can contribute meaningfully.

## Ireland: A New Chapter

Now, as a PhD student at the TCD-TUD Centre for Sociology of Humans and Machines in Dublin, I'm exploring new terrain. Rather than focusing narrowly on technical AI development, SOHAM emphasizes understanding the social dimensions of human-machine interaction. This sociological lens feels like a natural evolution of my journey.

### Why Sociology of AI?

My interest isn't in designing algorithms but in understanding how AI systems interact with human groups and affect collective decision-making. How do AI tools shape the ways groups think together? What biases emerge when groups use AI-facilitated processes? How do different cultural contexts mediate these dynamics?

These questions draw on everything I've learned: the systems thinking from my agricultural training, the collective intelligence frameworks from my Master's, the cross-cultural insights from living and working across Africa and Europe, and the practical understanding of group dynamics from my work at UM6P.

## Reflections on the Journey

Looking back, the path wasn't linear, but each stage built on the previous one in ways I couldn't have predicted:

- **Agricultural science** taught me about systems, interactions, and the importance of understanding context
- **Collective intelligence** provided frameworks for understanding how groups think and decide
- **Cross-cultural experiences** revealed how context shapes collaboration and decision-making
- **Professional work** showed the practical challenges of facilitating effective group processes
- **Sociology of AI** offers tools for understanding how technology mediates collective intelligence

## What I've Learned

Several themes have emerged across this journey:

**Context Matters**: Whether studying farming communities in Nigeria or AI systems in Europe, understanding the social, cultural, and organizational context is crucial for making sense of how people interact and make decisions together.

**Interdisciplinarity is Essential**: The most interesting questions don't fit neatly into single disciplines. Understanding collective intelligence requires insights from psychology, sociology, computer science, organizational studies, and more.

**Bridge Building is Valuable**: Moving between different intellectual traditions, geographic contexts, and methodological approaches has been challenging but rewarding. The ability to translate across these boundaries feels increasingly important.

**Practical Engagement Enriches Theory**: Working directly with communities, organizations, and diverse stakeholders has deepened my understanding of theoretical concepts in ways that purely academic study couldn't.

## Looking Forward

As I begin this PhD journey, I'm excited to continue exploring how AI systems can support—and potentially hinder—collective intelligence. I'm particularly interested in bringing cross-cultural perspectives to these questions and understanding how different social contexts shape human-AI collaboration.

The journey from agricultural science in Nigeria to sociology of AI in Ireland has been unexpected, but each step feels increasingly coherent. At its core, my research is about understanding how people think and decide together, and how we can create conditions—whether through agricultural extension systems, participatory governance, or AI tools—that support more effective collective intelligence.

I'm grateful for every stop along this journey and excited to see where the next phase leads.
