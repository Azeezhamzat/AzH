I've spent considerable time studying how groups make decisions—both in formal research settings and through my work facilitating partnerships across African institutions. One pattern keeps appearing: teams with genuinely smart, capable people making surprisingly poor decisions. The culprit? Social dynamics that systematically favor certain voices while silencing others.

This matters because we're facing challenges that require genuine collective intelligence—diverse perspectives coming together to generate insights no individual could produce alone. Yet most groups never reach this potential. Understanding why is the first step toward doing better.

## The Problem Hiding in Plain Sight

During my time at UM6P's Africa Initiative, I coordinated brainstorming sessions and workshops with participants from across the continent. I noticed something troubling: in many meetings, the pattern was predictable. Senior officials would speak first and longest. Others would nod along. Discussion would quickly converge around whatever the highest-ranking person suggested. Dissenting views, when they emerged at all, came wrapped in so many qualifications they lost their force.

This wasn't unique to one organization or culture. I saw similar patterns in Nigeria, Morocco, and now in Ireland. The details varied, but the underlying dynamic remained consistent: social hierarchies shaped what ideas got voiced, heard, and taken seriously.

Research confirms this isn't just my observation. Studies show that in typical group discussions, a small minority of participants do the vast majority of talking. More concerningly, speaking time correlates more with social status than with expertise on the topic at hand.

The cost of this pattern extends beyond hurt feelings. McKinsey research suggests that companies where diverse perspectives genuinely influence decisions significantly outperform competitors financially. Yet many organizations with demographic diversity on paper still struggle with what I think of as "participatory poverty"—lots of people in the room, but only a few voices shaping outcomes.

## Three Biases That Shape Who Gets Heard

### Authority Bias: When Status Trumps Substance

We're wired to pay more attention to high-status individuals. This made sense in environments where status correlated closely with relevant knowledge and experience. But in modern organizations, the person with the best insight on a technical problem might be a junior engineer, not the VP.

I remember a brainstorming session where a mid-level coordinator kept trying to raise a logistical concern about a proposed partnership. The concern was valid—she had direct experience with similar initiatives. But the conversation kept returning to the framing provided by senior leadership, who lacked this ground-level knowledge. The partnership proceeded. Six months later, it stalled for exactly the reason she'd identified.

Authority bias doesn't just mean we listen more to bosses. It means we unconsciously weight their ideas as more credible, interrupt them less, remember their points better, and find their reasoning more persuasive—even when expertise lies elsewhere.

### Conformity Pressure: The Pull of Agreement

Solomon Asch's famous experiments demonstrated something unsettling about human nature: faced with group consensus, people will deny the evidence of their own eyes. Participants gave clearly wrong answers to simple visual tasks just to avoid disagreeing with the group.

The workplace version looks less dramatic but carries similar dynamics. It's the rapid "sounds good!" email chain where nobody wants to be the contrarian. The meeting where challenging questions remain unasked. The project that continues despite widespread private doubts because nobody wants to "slow things down" or "be difficult."

During my Master's research on cluster farming in Nigeria, I interviewed smallholder farmers about new agricultural approaches. In group settings, farmers often expressed agreement with whatever the local leader said. In private conversations, many voiced concerns they hadn't felt comfortable raising publicly. The gap between public consensus and private reservations was substantial.

This conformity pressure affects everyone, but it falls hardest on those who already feel like outsiders—the only woman in a technical meeting, the sole junior staff member at a leadership table, the person whose educational or cultural background differs from the group norm.

### Groupthink: When Cohesion Kills Critique

Groupthink emerges when groups prioritize harmony and consensus over rigorous evaluation. Irving Janis, who coined the term while studying policy disasters, identified several warning signs: the illusion of unanimity, pressure on dissenters, and self-censorship by members who doubt the group's position.

I've observed this dynamic in partnership negotiations. Once a collaborative direction gains momentum, raising fundamental questions about approach or feasibility becomes increasingly difficult. The group has invested time and energy in a particular path. Questioning it feels like slowing progress or being "negative."

The result? Major decisions made with artificial confidence and inadequate scrutiny. Team members who recognized potential problems but stayed silent. Organizations that discovered too late that the consensus they celebrated masked underlying doubts.

## What Inclusive Decision-Making Actually Requires

Genuine inclusion means creating conditions where diverse perspectives can genuinely influence outcomes. This requires more than demographic representation—it requires structural changes to how groups operate.

### Anonymous Input: Separating Ideas from Identities

One effective approach: evaluate ideas without knowing who proposed them. This sounds simple, but it fundamentally changes group dynamics.

In my experience coordinating partnerships, I've seen how prior knowledge about a proposal's source shapes reception. Suggestions from prestigious institutions get taken more seriously than identical ideas from less-known organizations. This isn't necessarily conscious bias—it's pattern recognition operating where it shouldn't.

Digital tools make anonymous input straightforward. Before a meeting, circulate a form collecting ideas without attribution. Discuss and evaluate these ideas on merit before revealing sources. The shift can be striking—suddenly, good thinking gets recognized regardless of who produced it.

### Structured Participation: Making Space for All Voices

Left to natural dynamics, meetings tend toward familiar patterns. The most senior person speaks first and sets the frame. The most extroverted dominate discussion. Those with minority perspectives remain silent unless directly invited.

Structured participation disrupts these patterns. This might mean:

- **Round-robin contributions** where everyone speaks briefly before open discussion begins
- **Invitational facilitation** where the facilitator explicitly seeks input from those who haven't spoken
- **Speaking time tracking** that makes contribution patterns visible

During my time facilitating brainstorming sessions, I experimented with requiring a full round of input before open discussion. The difference was noticeable. People who typically stayed quiet had space to think and contribute. The discussion that followed incorporated a broader range of perspectives.

This feels artificial at first. We're used to "natural" conversation flow. But what feels natural is often just the grooves worn by repeated social patterns. Sometimes we need structure to enable the genuine diversity of thought that groups claim to want.

### Strategic Silence: Time to Think

Silence makes many people uncomfortable in group settings. We rush to fill conversational gaps. But building quiet time into group processes serves several purposes:

It distributes thinking time more equitably. Not everyone processes at the same speed. Some people think while talking; others need time to reflect before contributing. Immediate discussion favors the former at the expense of the latter.

It reduces conformity pressure. When people have time to form independent opinions before hearing others' views, they're more likely to voice genuine thoughts rather than align with emerging consensus.

It creates space for considered response. The best answer to a complex question often isn't the first thing that comes to mind. Quick discussion can reward fast thinking over deep thinking.

I've seen this work in practice. Before finalizing major partnership decisions, we instituted a reflection period—everyone took time to independently consider implications before we discussed as a group. The subsequent discussion was noticeably richer, raising considerations that hadn't emerged in our earlier, faster-paced meetings.

## What Changes Actually Look Like

Implementing these practices isn't about overhauling everything at once. It's about thoughtful experiments that gradually shift group dynamics.

**Start with awareness.** In your next few meetings, simply observe patterns. Who speaks and for how long? Who gets interrupted or built upon? Whose ideas are attributed versus whose get absorbed into "what we decided"? This baseline awareness is essential.

**Try one technique at a time.** Choose a single practice—anonymous input, structured turns, or strategic silence—and commit to it long enough to feel normal rather than novel. Give people time to adjust. What feels awkward initially often becomes valuable practice.

**Make the invisible visible.** When you notice social dominance patterns emerging, name them with curiosity rather than judgment. "I notice we're converging quickly on Sarah's framing—before we commit, let's do a round where everyone shares their initial reaction." This creates space for alternative perspectives without creating confrontation.

**Connect to outcomes.** Frame these changes around decision quality, not just fairness. Better decisions come from genuine consideration of diverse perspectives. This is about performance, not politics.

## Why This Matters for Collective Intelligence

My research focuses on collective intelligence—how groups can become smarter than their individual members. But this potential only realizes itself under specific conditions. Groups can also make decisions worse than any individual would make alone. The difference lies largely in whether social dynamics enable or suppress diverse input.

The challenges we face—climate change, public health, technological governance, sustainable development—require bringing together different types of expertise, cultural perspectives, and ways of thinking. No single person or homogeneous group can solve these problems alone. We need genuine collective intelligence.

But achieving this requires confronting how social hierarchies and conformity pressures shape what ideas get voiced, heard, and taken seriously. It requires building practices that counteract these tendencies—not because it's morally correct (though it is), but because it's functionally necessary for good group thinking.

The barriers to collective intelligence often aren't technical or informational—they're social. The knowledge the group needs may already be present, but trapped in hierarchies that privilege certain voices while silencing others. The solution isn't just gathering diverse people. It's creating conditions where diverse perspectives can genuinely shape outcomes.

## A Starting Point

If you're in a position to influence how your team makes decisions, I'd encourage you to try one thing: Before your next important decision, collect input anonymously. It doesn't need to be elaborate—a simple form asking "What opportunities and risks do you see in this approach?" will do.

Compare what emerges in anonymous input to what gets raised in your typical meetings. The gap often surprises people. It reveals how much relevant thinking exists but doesn't make it into official discussions.

This is just a starting point. Building genuine collective intelligence requires sustained attention to how social dynamics shape group thinking. But awareness is the first step. Once you see these patterns, you can begin addressing them.

The best ideas your team needs might already be present, just waiting for the right conditions to emerge.
